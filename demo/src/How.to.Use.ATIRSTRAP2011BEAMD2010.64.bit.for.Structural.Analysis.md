STRAP (STRuctural Analysis Programs) is a finite element static and dynamic analysis program that can handle various types of structures, loads, materials and design codes. It can also perform buckling, optimization, sway control and seismic analysis. STRAP can utilize 64-bit processors to reduce the solution time for large models by up to 90%[^1^].
 
BEAMD is a dedicated program for the design of reinforced concrete beams according to various international codes. It can also check existing beams for adequacy or redesign them for new loads. BEAMD can work as a standalone program or as an integrated module within STRAP[^2^].
 
To use ATIR.STRAP.2011.BEAMD.2010 64 bit, you need to have a Windows 7/VISTA/XP operating system and a valid license key. You can download the software from the official website of ATIR Software or from other sources such as LAVteam. After installing the software, you can launch it from the Start menu or from the desktop shortcut.
 
The software interface consists of a main window with menus, toolbars, tabs and panels. You can create a new project or open an existing one from the File menu. You can also import or export data from other formats such as DXF, DWG, STAAD or SAP2000. You can define the geometry, properties, loads and supports of your structure using the graphical or text input modes. You can also use the built-in wizards and libraries to simplify the input process.
 
After defining your model, you can perform the analysis by selecting the appropriate options from the Analysis menu. You can choose between linear or nonlinear analysis, static or dynamic analysis, modal or response spectrum analysis, etc. You can also specify the design code and parameters for steel or concrete design. The software will display the results in various forms such as tables, graphs, diagrams and animations. You can also generate detailed reports and print them or save them as PDF files.
 
If you want to use BEAMD for beam design, you can either launch it separately or access it from within STRAP. You can import beam data from STRAP or enter it manually. You can then specify the design code, load cases, reinforcement details and other options. The software will check the beam for strength, serviceability and deflection criteria and display the results in tables and diagrams. You can also modify the beam section or reinforcement layout and see the effect on the design.
 
ATIR.STRAP.2011.BEAMD.2010 64 bit is a comprehensive and user-friendly software package for structural analysis and design. It can help you to achieve economical and practical solutions for your engineering projects.
