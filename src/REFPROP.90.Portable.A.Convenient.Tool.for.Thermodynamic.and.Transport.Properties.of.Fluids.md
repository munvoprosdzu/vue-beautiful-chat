- Additional pure fluids and updated equations of state and transport equations, including cyclopentane, R-1234yf, and R-1234ze (E).
- The number of binary mixtures with interaction parameters has increased from 303 to 639, including many mixtures of ethylene, propylene, methanol, ethanol, toluene, benzene, cyclohexane, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, dodecane, acetone, and butylene.
- Expanded support for natural gas systems, including the addition of the GERG-2008 mixture model for natural gas fluids, which includes binary interaction parameters for 21 fluids.
- Improved convergence along the saturation lines for complex mixtures due to new algorithms for finding phase boundaries and the addition of analytical derivatives in the calculation of the fugacity.
- Calculation of net and gross heating values for natural gas systems.
- Additional pure fluid equations can be loaded in memory that are not included in a selected mixture.
- New plots that show deviations between the GERG-2008 equation and the AGA-8 natural gas mixture models.

REFPROP 9.0 Portable is a version of the software that can be run from a USB flash drive or any other removable media without installation. This makes it convenient for users who need to access the software on different computers or devices. REFPROP 9.0 Portable has the same functionality and performance as the regular version of REFPROP 9.0, except that it does not require a license key or activation.
  
To use REFPROP 9.0 Portable, you need to download the software from the NIST website (https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop) and extract the files to a folder on your removable media. Then you can run the REFPROP.EXE file from that folder to launch the graphical user interface (GUI) or use the DLL file to call REFPROP from other applications. You can also use the sample programs in Python, C++, MATLAB, VB, etc. that are provided with the software to demonstrate how to use REFPROP in different programming languages.
  
REFPROP 9.0 Portable is a useful tool for researchers, engineers, students, and anyone who needs reliable and accurate thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids. It can help you perform calculations and simulations involving fluid properties, phase equilibria, heat transfer, refrigeration cycles, combustion processes, natural gas systems, and more. With REFPROP 9.0 Portable, you can have access to the most comprehensive and up-to-date database of fluid properties anytime and anywhere.
  
REFPROP 9.0 Portable is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems. It can also be used with various software platforms, such as Excel, MATLAB, LabVIEW, EES, Aspen Plus, ANSYS Fluent, and more. You can find detailed instructions on how to use REFPROP 9.0 Portable with different applications in the documentation folder that comes with the software.
  
REFPROP 9.0 Portable is based on the most recent and reliable experimental data and theoretical models for fluid properties.
